# Automatization of Carl Zeiss GDM1000 monochromator

## What is it
Arduino sketch and Free Pascal unit for GDM1000 monochromator.

Here I have only the software without all the other stuff (circuitry and mechanic stuff).

The software has been tested for errors, stability and speed.

## Install

### Arduino

1. Make directory "GDM1000" in the sketchbook directory on your PC (it is "Arduino" by default, check the preferences in Arduino IDE).
2. Put the GDM1000.ino into "GDM1000" directory.
3. Open Arduino IDE and set your Arduino board
4. Check the sketch for errors and upload the sketch to the board.

### Free Pascal

1. Download GDM1000.pas and GDM1000.ini
2. Get ArduinoDevice.pas from [my Arduino device repository](https://github.com/serhiykobyakov/Arduino_device_FPC) 
3. Use repository info and and see the comments in files to get it work
