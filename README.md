# Carl Zeiss GDM1000 monochromator automatization

![Alt Text](https://github.com/serhiykobyakov/GDM1000_monochromator/blob/main/GDM1000.jpg)

## What is it

I attached a stepper motor to monochromator and now it can be positioned using PC instead of old-fashion manual control.

Here I have only the software without all the other stuff (circuitry and mechanic stuff). Arduino sketch and Free Pascal unit for GDM1000 monochromator.

The software has been tested for errors, stability and speed.
